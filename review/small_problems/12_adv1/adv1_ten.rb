# Write two methods: one that takes a Rational number as an argument, 
# and returns an Array of the denominators that are part of an Egyptian 
# Fraction representation of the number, and another that takes an Array 
# of numbers in the same format, and calculates the resulting Rational number. 
# You will need to use the Rational class provided by Ruby.
