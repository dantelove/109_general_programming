# Create a method that takes 2 arguments, an array and a hash. The array 
# will contain 2 or more elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces, 
# will produce a person's name. The hash will contain two keys, :title and 
# :occupation, and the appropriate values. Your method should return a 
# greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title.

def greetings(array, hash)
  "=> Hello, #{array.join(" ")}! Nice to have a #{hash[:title]} " + 
  "#{hash[:occupation]} around."
end

p greetings(['John', 'Q', 'Doe'], { title: 'Master', occupation: 'Plumber' })
